			Technology in and of itself is quite amazing; technology brings people together, provides information, helps those in need, and grants nearly everyone entertainment, no doubt about it. It goes hand in hand with science and brings about new advancements constantly. But technology also has as many downfalls as it does accomplishments, and the people at fault are the large corporations behind the innovations. Major offenses include tracking users and collecting data, incentivizing addiction and building reliance and anonymizing hate messages that otherwise could’ve been prevented. “The Social Dilemma”, a documentary created by Netflix, reveals that retired developers for these platforms are concerned for their users and the platform they've worked tirelessly on. This is the new age of the Internet: <b>misinformation</b>, <b>isolation</b>, and <b>manipulation</b>.

			<b>Misinformation</b> is an extremely volatile topic online; children and adults alike are perceiving false information as real, leading to the health of these people possibly being jeopardized. Fake news itself is archaic, but as our ability to communicate gets better and better, so does the spread of fake news. In a study done by MIT in 2018, they learned that false info spreads six times faster than true news. Fake news mainly spreads through social media such as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, but the consequences of such widespread technology and incorrect information is an increasing number of deaths due to avertible causes. Tech companies should have a responsibility 	to protect their users from this fake info, such as how Reddit recently banned anti-vaccination believers and fake “COVID-cures” like ivermectin. I myself have done many things to protect myself from fake news; by not using social media as much and checking the sources of questionable topics. I believe it’s time for both the population and the corporations to step up and try and stop this problem.

			<b>Isolation</b> is a growing worry for parents, children seem to be spending more and more time in their rooms and on their phones. It is a justified worry however, according to Oberlo: in 2011 only 31% of Americans owned smartphones, now that number is at 88% in 2021. Elite Content Marketer states that teens now spend around 5.1 hours a day on their smartphone, which is about a 5th of the day. This is a huge issue for a lot of people, from kids to the elderly, almost everyone uses their phone. Infinite Internet access should be allowed if parents believe so, but only when the user isn’t isolated. My parents were able to fix this issue with me by placing my computer right in the living room, so I can always stay connected with them and they can stay connected with me. I believe other parents could fix this by making sure teens can’t charge their phone in their room, making conversation, and getting their children into some hobbies. After all, the best way to spend your time is doing something productive and enjoyable, not staring into a screen isolated from your friends and family.

			<b>Manipulation</b> is terrifying. Just the thought of being controlled and told what to do whilst being online, which is meant to be a place for freedom, is scary. What’s even scarier is that social media apps have been mastering the art of manipulation for over 10 years through algorithms. Algorithms are a set of rules followed by computers, and in this case social media apps utilizes them to make sure you’re spending the most amount of time possible. These algorithms have the special ability to learn and adapt their own rules, which makes it seem like they have a mind of their own, so to speak. Algorithms have got so advanced that it seems like we, as customers and users, have lost control of the info being displayed to us. A majority of popular apps includes some form of it and there truly is no way to get away from all of it: Google uses it, YouTube uses it, Reddit uses it, Twitter uses it, Instagram uses it, Facebook uses it, and as such there isn’t a concrete way to avoid this form of manipulation. For me, the best way to solve this issue is to use Google’s built in “incognito” mode and research true news from 	there. Search results tend to skew depending on what you’ve previously inquired, and by logging out of your account (which is practically what 	incognito mode does) the results are usually normalized. However, there is no true normal anymore; everyone's results are skewed in some way.

			All in all, technology has its ups and downs; its goods and bads. Digital education and information, but sometimes that information isn’t true; freedom of speech, but nearly everyone can and will be anonymous; endless entertainment, but growing isolation and addiction. Social media causes teens to feel bad and harm themselves when they compare themselves to others who use makeup and filters. Misinformation spreads very quickly, and sometimes people get addicted to fake news and isolate themselves due to said addiction. Social media manipulates people into thinking differently by showing users different content. But it’s not all bad, if you know what’s real and what’s not, it can be a good news output and a way to communicate with friends and family. That, however, is not reason enough to simply ignore the facts: social media is currently doing more harm than good to most of the population.
